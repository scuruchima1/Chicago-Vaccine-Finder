# Chicago-Vaccine-Finder
Chicago Vaccine Finder uses selenium web scraping along with a discord API in order to alert users to vaccine availability within Chicago. Vaccine data is also collected via a google sheets API.

## This program is now deprecated as vaccine availability has increased and as vaccines have become easily accessible
